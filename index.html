      <font size="4"> <p align="justify"> Bees fly from flower to flower, sipping nectar and collecting               grains of pllen. Bees have a special tongue that sucks up the nectar and a crop in their throat for storing it until they get back to the hive, where it is turned into use as food.</p></font>
